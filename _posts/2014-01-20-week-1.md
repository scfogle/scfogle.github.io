# WEEK 1 BLOG POST

favoirte internet thing...

One of the distributors I use at the garden store recently updated their website.
and now i can save multiple shopping carts and toggle between them when ordering inventory, its probably the most useful feature ive used on a website to date. seems lame but its cool.
[sunlightsupply.com](http://sunlightsupply.com)
but you probably cant see what im talking about because you need an account to login to see shopping carts.

thats all.
